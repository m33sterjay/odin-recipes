A basic recipe website as part of the The Odin Project curriculum

This will be a basic recipe website that will be iterated on multiple times through "The Odin Project" curriculum.
Thus far I have learned the basics of HTML, including the common elements, such as:
- the basic structure of an HTML page
- <p> paragraph elements
- <h1> the different headers and their purpose
- <li> ordered and unordered lists
- <strong> & <em> elements to create bold (<strong>) text and italic (<em>) text
- <a> anchors, which create links to other webpages using <a href="(path)">(text)</a>
- <img> which is one a few elements that doesn't have a close tag - which is used to link images using <img src="(source)">
- I've also learned about absolute and relative links
