            <p><li class="steps">Prepare Spaghetti</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Begin by boiling a large pot of water.</li>
                <li>When at a rolling boil, carefully submerge spaghetti into water.</li>
                <li>Cover and reduce heat but keep boiling, be sure to stir occasionally to prevent sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Boil for 20 minutes or until al dente. Season with a pinch of salt.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p><li class="steps">Cook Ground Beef</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a skillet. Chop onion and garlic.</li>
                <li>Place ground beef in the skillet and begin breaking it up with a wooden spoon until satisfied; season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>When beef is 75% browned, throw in onion and garlic. Cook until onion is translucent and beef is browned.</li>
                <li>When beef is browned, remove skillet from heat and drain excess fat.</li>
                <li>Return beef to the skillet.</li>
            </ul></p>

                <li>Carefully submerge 4 bayleaf leaves in the sauce. Leave mixed in until ready to serve, then remove from sauce and discard.</li>
                <li>Simmer sauce on low heat until reduced and a consistency you prefer. Be sure to stir occasionally to avoid burning.</li>
            </ul></p>
